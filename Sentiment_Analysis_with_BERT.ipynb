Food comes very fast, and you won't regret ordering. The egg sandwich was amazingly good; the egg was scrambled but had that runny texture, plus it was very creamy. The original milk pudding (best hot), was so soft and you can really taste the milk behind it.

If you're coming here with a small party, be prepare to sit in tight knit tables with strangers (this is how the line moves fast). ADC is CASH ONLY and they ONLY speak Chinese and have Chinese ONLY menus. If you don't read Chinese, I would suggest you show pictures on yelp and tell them. I strongly suggest first timers to order the breakfast combo (~48HKD). It comes with HK's popular cafe dishes: ham and macaroni, toast and egg, coffee/hk milk tea. The waiter will ask how you want your eggs and toast, make sure you tell or point to butter toast with scramble egg!!!! This is the must try dish and you have to order it here!!! The macaroni and ham was mediocre, and the hk style milk tea was just okay. Dessert has to be ordered last or after you finish your meal (due to lack of space on the table). You pay at the front of the restaurant when you are finish with you meal. Please note that ADC is crazy busy all the time, so the waiters aren't the nicest people due to speed.

The line here is usually half a block. Don't worry, they move pretty fast with their efficiency. There's a guy that goes up and down the line and takes down the number of people in your party. It seems like the bigger the party, the quicker it is (complete opposite). If you're coming here with a small party, be prepare to sit in tight knit tables with strangers (this is how the line moves fast). ADC is CASH ONLY and they ONLY speak Chinese and have Chinese ONLY menus. If you don't read Chinese, I would suggest you show pictures on yelp and tell them. I strongly suggest first timers to order the breakfast combo (~48HKD). It comes with HK's popular cafe dishes: ham and macaroni, toast and egg, coffee/hk milk tea. The waiter will ask how you want your eggs and toast, make sure you tell or point to butter toast with scramble egg!!!! This is the must try dish and you have to order it here!!! The macaroni and ham was mediocre, and the hk style milk tea was just okay. Dessert has to be ordered last or after you finish your meal (due to lack of space on the table). You pay at the front of the restaurant when you are finish with you meal. Please note that ADC is crazy busy all the time, so the waiters aren't the nicest people due to speed. They tend to take no bs, and expects you to know exactly what you're ordering.\"]"
